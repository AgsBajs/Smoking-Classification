Smoking Prediction with Logistic Regression

Using the Global Coffee Health Dataset (Kaggle)

📌 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between lifestyle factors and smoking behavior using the Global Coffee Health Dataset
. The primary goal was to build a predictive model to identify smokers based on demographic, lifestyle, and health-related features.

We compared baseline models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest), tuned Logistic Regression, and explored the role of decision thresholds in balancing precision and recall.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 10,000 synthetic records reflecting realistic correlations between coffee consumption, sleep, and health outcomes across 20 countries.

Features

ID (int) → Unique record ID

Age (int) → Participant age (18–80)

Gender (cat) → Male, Female, Other

Country (cat) → Country of residence (20 total)

Coffee_Intake (float) → Cups of coffee per day (0–10)

Caffeine_mg (float) → Estimated daily caffeine intake in mg

Sleep_Hours (float) → Hours of sleep per night (3–10)

Sleep_Quality (cat) → Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent

BMI (float) → Body Mass Index (15–40)

Heart_Rate (int) → Resting heart rate (50–110 bpm)

Stress_Level (cat) → Low, Medium, High

Physical_Activity_Hours (float) → Weekly physical activity (0–15 hours)

Health_Issues (cat) → None, Mild, Moderate, Severe

Occupation (cat) → Office, Healthcare, Student, Service, Other

Smoking (bool) → Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Alcohol_Consumption (bool) → 0 = No, 1 = Yes

🔎 Methodology

Preprocessing

Imputed missing values (median for numerics, most frequent for categoricals).

Standardized numeric features.

One-hot encoded categorical features.

Baseline Models

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Observed poor performance from Random Forest due to high sparsity after one-hot encoding and class imbalance.

Model Tuning

GridSearchCV on Logistic Regression (C, penalty, solver).

Chose Logistic Regression with L2 penalty, C ≈ 1.445, solver = liblinear.

Threshold Tuning

Explored thresholds 0.3–0.7.

Found 0.45 yielded the best trade-off:

Precision ≈ 0.201

Recall ≈ 0.828

F1 Score ≈ 0.323

ROC-AUC ≈ 0.507 and PR-AUC ≈ 0.208 show the dataset has weak signal for smoking prediction, but recall-focused thresholds enable screening.

📈 Results

Default (0.50 threshold) → Recall = 0.429, F1 = 0.274

Chosen (0.45 threshold) → Recall = 0.828, F1 = 0.323

Confusion Matrix @ 0.45:

[[ 276 1323]
 [  69  332]]

🌍 Social & Ethical Impact

Positive: Can serve as a screening tool to flag potential smokers for further support or counseling. High recall ensures most smokers are identified.

Risks: Low precision (~20%) means many non-smokers are flagged, which could lead to stigma or wasted resources if used incorrectly.

Recommendation: Use only in research or early warning contexts, never as a sole decision-making tool for individuals.
